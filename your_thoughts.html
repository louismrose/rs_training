	          <h2>RS Training Forum (12/03/12)</h2>
	          <p>Thoughts and issues raised at the RS training forum are below.</p>
	          
	          <h4>Training courses</h4>
	          <ul>
	            <li>RDT courses are sometimes not tailored towards our discipline, and hence are not as useful as they could be.</li>
	            <li>Lack of useful training for experimental method, statistics and referencing; and for specific tools (e.g. MS Word, LaTeX, Eclipse, EndNote/CiteULike/Mendely, SPSS/R).</li>
	            <li>Induction activities do not necessarily suit all RSes, possibly because RSes come from different backgrounds (both academic and cultural).</li>
	          </ul>
	          
	          <h4>Reliance on tacit information</h4>
	          <ul>
	            <li>Key information for RSes is scattered across the departmental and university websites and other resources (e.g. handbook).</li>
	            <li>It's not always clear who (in the department or university) to ask in order to solve a problem.</li>
	            <li> Lack of structure in introductory processes, and particularly for non-October starters.</li>
	          </ul>
	          
	          <h4>Community</h4>
	          <ul>
	            <li>Lack of peer-to-peer sharing of knowledge between RSes.</li>
	            <li>Lack of "group unity" (community feeling?).</li>
	            <li>Not all RSes have opportunities to give many presentations (other than literature review seminar and thesis seminar).</li>
