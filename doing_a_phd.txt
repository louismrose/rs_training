Dear final-year undergraduate and Masters students,

For those of you interested in learning more about doctoral research (e.g. a PhD of EngD), the following event in Computer Science might be of interest to you.

"Doing a PhD" (in Computer Science)
Wednesday 16th November, 1515 to 1715, RCH/Lakehouse (Heslington East)

Are you considering -- or just curious about -- a doctoral degree? In this series of
short talks by academics from the Dept. of Computer Science, you will discover what
doctoral research involves, how a research degree can benefit you, and where our 
former doctoral students are now. Funding opportunities and possible research topics 
will also be discussed, and you will have the chance to ask questions to many of the
senior academics in the Dept. of Computer Science.

For more information, please contact Louis Rose (louis@cs.york.ac.uk).


Best regards,
Louis.
