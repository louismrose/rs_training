              <strong>York Doctoral Symposium (YDS)</strong> is an annual event at which Research Students present and discuss their 
            	research with other students and academics. Becoming part of the team that organises and manages YDS is excellent, practical training in conducting research.

	        <section id="introduction">
          	<h2>Why should I be involved?</h2>
          	<p>For the participants, YDS provides an excellent opportunity to
          	gather feedback on their research, learn about the work of others, and practice 
          	presenting research in a friendly and familiar environment. For the organisers, YDS is 
          	a fantastic opportunity to gain experience in organising a research event, which is
          	a key part of research both in academic and industrial settings.</p>
          	<p>It's also a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58340555@N03/sets/72157627960465536/">lot</a> of
          	  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCAC2AB3CA5254E64">fun</a>.</p>
	
          	<h2>How can I be involved?</h2>
          	<p>There are three ways in which you might want to be involved with YDS:</p>
          	<ol>
          		<li><strong>Volunteers currently needed:</strong> <a href="#organisers">Join the organising committee</a> (planning, managing and running the event, and spending money!)</li>
          		<li><a href="#reviewers">Review submissions as part of the programme committee</a> (selecting the technical content, and awarding money!)</li>
          		<li><a href="#participants">Submit a paper or poster and speaking at the event</a> (showing off your work, getting feedback and winning money!)</li>
          	</ol>
        	</section>

        	<section id="organisers">
          	<h2>Organisers</h2>
          	<p>Running a successful edition of YDS typically requires a small team (e.g. 6 or 7 people) of
          	organisers.</p>
	
          	<h3>What responsibilities do organisers have?</h3>
          	<p>The organisers decide on and implement all organisational and financial matters.
          	A budget is allocated to the organisers, which they can spend however they see fit
          	(within reason!) In 2011, the organisers
          	were responsible for marketing, seeking sponsorship money, inviting external speakers, 
          	purchasing catering, producing registration packs, organising the conference dinner, 
          	booking venues, preparing rooms, and filming and photography.</p>
	
          	<p>There are two roles within the team of organisers that are particularly unique, and 
          	  deserve a more thorough explanation: General Chair, and Chair of the Programme Committee...</p>
	  
          	<h3>What responsibilities does the General Chair have?</h3>
          	<p>The General Chair oversees all of the undertakings of the organisers. They are ultimately
          	  responsible for YDS and its success! Typically, this role is shared between two organisers.</p>
	  
          	<h3>What responsibilities does the Chair of the Programme Committee have?</h3>
          	<p>The Chair of the Programme Committee is responsible for the technical content of YDS. For
          	  example, the Chair of the Programme Committee prepares and distributes the calls for papers
          	  and posters, allocates submissions to reviewers, oversees the reviewing process, and leads
          	  the decisions for best paper and poster prizes.</p>
	
          	<h3>Why should I be involved with organising YDS?</h3>
          	<p>The official answer: conferences and symposia are an integral part of conducting research, and 
          	developing the skills necessary to organise such events will make you a better researcher and 
          	will look good on your CV.</p>
          	</p>The unofficial answer: it's hard work, but immensely satisfying and enjoyable.</p>
	
          	<h3>Who can be involved with organising YDS?</h3>
          	<p>Any Research Student in the Dept. of Computer Science. Typically, second-year Research Students
          	take the more involved roles (e.g. general or programme committee chairs) as they are
          	not writing their thesis or qualifying dissertation (unlike Research Students in their first, third
          	or fourth years).</p>
	
          	<h3>When is the workload for organisers?</h3>
          	<p>The majority of the organisers' work takes place between January and October. YDS is typically 
          	held some time between mid-October and the start of November.</p>
	
          	<h3>How is YDS funded?</h3>
          	<p>In previous years, YDS was funded mostly by Roberts' money, which was allocated to the 
          	Dept. of Computer Science from the University and to be used exclusively for training
          	Research Students.</p>
          	<p>From 2012, Robert's money will no longer be available, and we are seeking alternative ways
          	of funding YDS. For the first time, the Dept. of Computer Science has committed to partial 
          	funding of YDS from its own coffers. I am bidding for further money from the University's 
          	Research Development Team. As in previous years, the organising committee may decide to seek
          	industrial sponsorship.</p>
	
          	<h3>How will funding changes affect the 2012 edition?</h3>
          	<p>In short: not too much. In the worst case, the organising committee will need to cut 
          	expenses by about 25% (which the chairs of YDS 2011 have confirmed is entirely feasible).
          	However, I am optimistic that instead we will be able to raise enough money such that
          	cuts will not be necessary.</p>

            <h3>How do I get involved as an organiser?</h3>
            <p><a href="mailto:louis@cs.york.ac.uk">Email me</a> by the the 2nd of December, 
            indicating whether you would like to be considered for General or Programme Committee Chair.</p>
  
            <p>I will hold a short meeting of the organisers in December 2011 at which the organising
              committee will be formed, and the chairs will be selected (as democratically as possible!).</p>

        	<section id="reviewers">
          	<h2>Reviewers</h2>
          	<p>As is the case at most academic conferences and symposia, submissions to YDS are 
          	peer reviewed: a group of Research Students and academics from the Dept. of Computer
          	Science to assess the quality and soundness of each submission. The reviewing process
          	involves selecting the best submissions, which will then be presentation at YDS.</p> 
	
          	<h3>Why should I be involved with reviewing submissions to YDS?</h3>
          	<p>Reviewing is a fantastic way to learn what makes a good -- and a bad -- paper, and
          	how to improve your own work. YDS has a broad range of submissions, and hence you will
          	have the opportunity to learn more about areas of Computer Science other than your own.
          	Finally, it's a relatively light workload compared to being an organiser.</p>
	
          	<h3>Who can be involved with reviewing submissions to YDS?</h3>
          	<p>Any Research Student in the Dept. of Computer Science. Typically, several members
          	of academic staff also assist with the reviewing process.</p>
	
          	<h3>When is the workload for reviewers?</h3>
          	<p>For YDS 2011, reviewing took place in July (for papers) and August (for posters).</p>
	
          	<h3>How do I get involved as a reviewer?</h3>
            <p>Please look out for an email from the programme committee chair, in early 2012.</p>
        	</section>

          <section id="participants">
            <h2>Participants</h2>
            <p>Any and all Research Students can submit to YDS. In 2011, submissions were either longer
              papers, shorter papers, or posters. In the past, submissions have mostly been from 
              Research Students in the Dept. of Computer Science, but not exclusively: submissions are
              received from Research Students in other departments and at other universities.</p>
    
            <h3>Why should I submit to YDS?</h3>
            <p>For many reasons:
              <ul>
                <li>YDS is an accessible (it won't cost you anything to attend), friendly
              (you will know most of the audience) and constructive (everyone wants to help) environment for
              presenting your work.</li>
                <li>You might gain invaluable advice or ideas that help with your research.</li>
                <li>It's a good excuse to write up some of your work, which you might be able
                  to use as part of your thesis or qualifying dissertation.</li>
                <li>It's good practice for presenting at a conference and other public speaking.</li>
                <li>You will get to know and learn more about the work of other Research Students in your department.</li>
                <li>You will enjoy a delicious and entertaining conference dinner!</li>
                <li>You might win a best paper prize!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
    
            <h3>Can research presented at YDS be published at a conference?</h3>
            <p>Typically, the YDS proceedings have not been published and hence participants have not signed 
              a copyright agreement with a publisher. Therefore, participants have been free to publish their
              work elsewhere. Ultimately though, this is a question for the organising committee of the current
              edition of YDS.</p>
            <p>Related to this, simultaneous submission (e.g. submitting a paper to YDS, and submitting the same
               or a similar paper to another conference during the time of the YDS reviewing process) is
               typically <strong>not</strong> allowed.</p>

            <h3>How do I get involved as a participant?</h3>
            <p>Look out for the calls for papers and posters in Spring 2012.</p>
