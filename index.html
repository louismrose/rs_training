  <h1>Training for Research Students</h1>
  <p>
    Increasingly, a doctoral degree involves developing the skills necessary to become an independent researcher,
    and not "just" making an outstanding contribution to your scientific community.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page contains information 
    about the training opportunities available to Research Students in the 
    department, is maintained by the Research Student Training Officer (currently 
    <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/?username=louis">Louis Rose</a>),
    and discusses the following:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#training_centres">Training Centres and PFA</a> (where can I receive training?)</li>
    <li><a href="#local_events">Upcoming Training Events in the Department</a></li>
    <li><a href="#skillsforge_events">Upcoming Skillsforge Events</a></li>
    <li><a href="#staff">Staff involved with Research Student Training</a> (who do I speak with about training?)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Two key training activities deserve special mention:
    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="yds.html">York Doctoral Symposium<a> (a research event run by research students for research students) provides fantastic hands-on training in running and participating in research events.</li>
      <li>becoming a <a href="../PGTeachingAssistants">Postgraduate Teaching Assistant (PTA)</a> is an excellent opportunity to further develop teaching skills, and to earn a little extra money.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Latest News</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Paul Cairns has kindly offered to deliver a one- or two-day training course (dates to be confirmed based on interest) in quantitive research methods and statistics. Please <a href="mailto:louis@cs.york.ac.uk">email me</a> to register your interest.</li>
    <li>Later this term (once the new RS rep has been elected), I will organise a discussion at which I'd like to hear your opinions on RS training.</li>
    <li>Applications for the excellent <a href="#pfa">PFA</a> programme will open again later this term.</li>
  </ul>

    Once you have identified skills in which you wish to receive training, the
    following resources can help you to choose an appropriate course. If you 
    find that there is not an appropriate course for a skill that you wish to 
    develop, please <a href="#staff">tell us</a>.

  <h3><a name="pfa">Preparing Future Academics</a></h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/hr/researcher-development/pfa/">
    Preparing Future Academics</a> (PFA) is a training programme, which helps
    research students to further develop learning and teaching techniques.
    Participants develop a portfolio throughout the programme, and prizes are
    typically awarded for the strongest portfolios.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an <strong>excellent</strong> programme, and is largely unrivalled
    -- there is very little like this at other UK universities. Applications 
    for the 2012/13 programme open in Spring 2012, and there has been fairly strong
    competition for places in previous years.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="pst">Peer-Supported Teaching Groups</a></h3>
  <p>
    Research students are invited to join the department's Peer-Supported
    Teaching groups, which involve discussion of teaching principles and 
    practice. This year's groups are focusing on topics such as teaching
    AI to undergraduates, putting a module online and innovative methods of
    assessment.
  </p>
  <p>Meetings of the PST groups will be fairly infrequent, and hence this is
    a simple way to develop and reflect on any of the teaching you may do
    in the department. Sign up for one or more PSTs is via
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdmdz9Yh6J-GAxMSvTheBwQbBcnVIBIP5q17VjQDELM/edit">this Google doc</a>.
