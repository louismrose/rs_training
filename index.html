  <h1>Training for Research Students</h1>
  <p>
    Increasingly, a doctoral degree involves developing the skills necessary to become an independent researcher,
    and not "just" making an outstanding contribution to your scientific community.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page contains information 
    about the training opportunities available to Research Students in the 
    department, is maintained by the Research Student Training Officer (currently 
    <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/?username=louis">Louis Rose</a>),
    and discusses the following:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#training_centres">Training Centres and PFA</a> (where can I receive training?)</li>
    <!-- <li><a href="#local_events">Upcoming Training Events in the Department</a></li> -->
    <li><a href="#skillsforge_events">Upcoming Skillsforge Events</a></li>
    <li><a href="#staff">Staff involved with Research Student Training</a> (who do I speak with about training?)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Two key training activities deserve special mention:
    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="yds.html">York Doctoral Symposium<a> (a research event run by research students for research students) provides fantastic hands-on training in running and participating in research events.</li>
      <li>becoming a <a href="../PGTeachingAssistants">Postgraduate Teaching Assistant (PTA)</a> is an excellent opportunity to further develop teaching skills, and to earn a little extra money.</li>
    </ul>

      To gather your opinions and suggestions to improvement for RS training, I'd like to ask
      all Research Students to attend a short discussion. There will be drinks and snacks, and 
      a social event afterwards (my thanks to Jose for organising!).</li>
    <li>Applications are now open for <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/admin/hr/researcher-development/students/Enterprising%20Researcher/2012/index.htm">The Enterprising Researcher 2012</a>, a 4-day residential training designed to enhance the entrepreneurial skills of researchers. Applications are due on the 9th March.</li>

  <h3><a name="pfa">Preparing Future Academics</a></h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/hr/researcher-development/pfa/">
    Preparing Future Academics</a> (PFA) is a training programme, which helps
    research students to further develop learning and teaching techniques.
    Participants develop a portfolio throughout the programme, and prizes are
    typically awarded for the strongest portfolios.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an <strong>excellent</strong> programme, and is largely unrivalled
    -- there is very little like this at other UK universities. Applications 
    for the 2012/13 programme open in Spring 2012, and there has been fairly strong
    competition for places in previous years.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="pst">Peer-Supported Teaching Groups</a></h3>
  <p>
    Research students are invited to join the department's Peer-Supported
    Teaching groups, which involve discussion of teaching principles and 
    practice. This year's groups are focusing on topics such as teaching
    AI to undergraduates, putting a module online and innovative methods of
    assessment.
  </p>
  <p>Meetings of the PST groups will be fairly infrequent, and hence this is
    a simple way to develop and reflect on any of the teaching you may do
    in the department. Sign up for one or more PSTs is via
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdmdz9Yh6J-GAxMSvTheBwQbBcnVIBIP5q17VjQDELM/edit">this Google doc</a>.

  <p><a href="http://www.skillsforge.york.ac.uk/york/#">Skillsforge</a> is a suite of online tools that assists research students 
     in their training and evaluation of their practice. For example, you can use Skillsforge to record a research journal and 
     to locate and register for training courses run by the university. The following events are available via Skillsforge in 
     the next month or two.
