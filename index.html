              Increasingly, a doctoral degree involves developing the skills necessary to become an independent researcher,
              as well as making an outstanding contribution to your scientific community.

          <h3>Preparing Future Academics</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/hr/researcher-development/pfa/">
            Preparing Future Academics</a> (PFA) is a training programme that helps
            research students to further develop learning and teaching techniques.
            Participants develop a portfolio throughout the programme, and prizes are
            typically awarded for the strongest portfolios.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an <strong>excellent</strong> programme, and is largely unrivalled
            - there is very little like this at other UK universities. Applications 
            for the 2012/13 programme open in Spring 2012, and there has been fairly strong
            competition for places in previous years.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Peer-Supported Teaching Groups</h3>
          <p>
            Research students are invited to join the department's Peer-Supported
            Teaching groups, which involve discussion of teaching principles and 
            practice. This year's groups are focusing on topics such as teaching
            AI to undergraduates, putting a module online and innovative methods of
            assessment.
          </p>
          <p>Meetings of the PST groups will be fairly infrequent, and hence this is
            a simple way to develop and reflect on any of the teaching you may do
            in the department. Sign up for one or more PSTs is via
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdmdz9Yh6J-GAxMSvTheBwQbBcnVIBIP5q17VjQDELM/edit">this Google doc</a>.

            <p><a href="http://www.skillsforge.york.ac.uk/york/#">Skillsforge</a> is a suite of online tools that assists research students 
               in their training and evaluation of their practice. For example, you can use Skillsforge to record a research journal and 
               to locate and register for training courses run by the university. The following events are available via Skillsforge in
