  <h1>Training for Research Students</h1>
  <p>
    Increasingly, a doctoral degree involves developing the skills necessary to become an independent researcher,
    and not just making an outstanding contribution to your scientific community. This page contains information 
    about the training opportunities available to Research Students in the 
    department, and is maintained by the Research Student Training Officer (currently 
    <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/?username=louis">Louis Rose</a>). Please get in touch if you
    wish to discuss any aspect of your training as a Research Student.
