              Increasingly, a doctoral degree involves developing the skills necessary to become an independent researcher,
              as well as making an outstanding contribution to your scientific community. These pages summarise the training
              opportunities available to doctoral students.

			<h2>Upcoming Departmental training events</h2>
			<p>This summer we will run departmental training workshops on communicating your research. These will be practical, hands-on workshops (rather than lectures), and you may find the attending the workshops helps you to prepare a submission for <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/yds">York Doctoral Symposium</a>, or to review the submissions of others.</p>

			<h3>Starting your doctorate</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>30th October, 1400 to 1515 (CSE/082) - <strong>Finding and Reviewing Literature</strong>, Dr. Will Smith.</li>
			  <li>6th November, 1400 to 1600 (CSE/02) - <strong>Giving a Presentation</strong>, Dr. Alistair Edwards.</li>
			</ul>
			
            <h2>Upcoming University training events</h2>
            <p><a href="http://www.skillsforge.york.ac.uk/york/#">Skillsforge</a> is a suite of online tools that assists research students 
               in their training and evaluation of their practice. For example, you can use Skillsforge to record a research journal and 
               to locate and register for training courses run by the university.</p>
               
            <p>The following courses are available via Skillsforge in the next month or two.</p>

          <h3 id="#pfa">Preparing Future Academics</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/hr/researcher-development/pfa/">
            Preparing Future Academics</a> (PFA) is a training programme that helps
            research students to further develop learning and teaching techniques.
            Participants develop a portfolio throughout the programme, and prizes are
            typically awarded for the strongest portfolios.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an <strong>excellent</strong> programme, and is largely unrivalled
            - there is very little like this at other UK universities.
            <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/hr/researcher-development/pfa/">Applications 
            are closed</a> for the 2012/13 programme, but it is worth preparing in advance if
            you are considering applying for 2013/14.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Peer-Supported Teaching Groups</h3>
          <p>
            Research students are invited to join the department's Peer-Supported
            Teaching groups, which involve discussion of teaching principles and 
            practice. This year's groups are focusing on topics such as teaching
            AI to undergraduates, putting a module online and innovative methods of
            assessment.
          </p>
          <p>Meetings of the PST groups will be fairly infrequent, and hence this is
            a simple way to develop and reflect on any of the teaching you may do
            in the department. Sign up for one or more PSTs is via
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdmdz9Yh6J-GAxMSvTheBwQbBcnVIBIP5q17VjQDELM/edit">this Google doc</a>.
